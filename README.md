Portfolio project, made by Timofey Ivanov, where one can see my projects, their description and visit them online. 

I have made following file changes:
Changed font to Times New Roman
Changed background file to black
Added grey font shadows

To fellow developer:
	If you want to change any information in this portfolio, be sure to change data.jsonâ€™s file content. If you want to change style, you are more welcome to make changes to the end of the CSS file or add your own and link it in the head of the layout.pug file, below the other CSS links.
